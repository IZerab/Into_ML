# Into_ML

This is the repository that includes all the 6 assignments that I had to do for the course "Machine Learning" held by S. Tschiatschek in the 2021 WS.

The exercises covers intermediate and advanced topics in Machine Learning, such as MLPs, SVMs and various types of unsupervised learning tools.

The language I used is Python any version version 3.8.x. or higher is supposed to work.
